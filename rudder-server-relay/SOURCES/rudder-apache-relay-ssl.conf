# Explanation
# 1. The Rewriterule pattern is matched
#   Yes -> if so the result goes to $0,$1,$2
#   No  -> no rewrite, no access to the files
# 2. The RewriteCond is checked
#   -> Get client uuid from %{SSL:SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_UID}
#   -> Get requested uuid from the Rewriterule pattern ($1)
#   -> Generate a TestString of the form "<client_uuid>=<requested_uuid>"
#   -> Test the string against a regex that check that the left part is identical to the right part
# 3. The Rewriterule is applied
#   -> final path is generated from the rule pattern
